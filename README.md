# Draw Anime App

**A Flutter application that helps users draw anime-style art, potentially using AR features for tracing and guidance.**

## About The Project

Draw Anime App is designed for anime enthusiasts and aspiring artists who want to create their own anime-style artwork. The application provides intuitive tools for drawing, and we plan to incorporate Augmented Reality (AR) features to allow users to trace over images or real-world objects, making the learning process more interactive and effective.

Key functionalities include:
* Image importing for references.
* A variety of drawing tools tailored for anime art.
* Basic layer management.
* (Planned) AR Tracing Mode for guided drawing.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Flutter SDK: >=3.4.3
    *   You can find instructions on how to install Flutter [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
*   A code editor like VS Code or Android Studio.
*   An emulator or a physical device to run the app.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/draw-anime-app.git
    ```
    *(Replace `https://github.com/your-username/draw-anime-app.git` with the actual repository URL once available)*
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd draw-anime-app
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```
4.  **Run the app:**
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```

## Usage

Once the app is running:
1.  You can start a new drawing by creating a new canvas.
2.  Import reference images if needed.
3.  Use the available drawing tools (brushes, eraser, color picker) to create your artwork.
4.  Utilize layers to organize different parts of your drawing (e.g., sketch, line art, color).
    *(More detailed usage instructions will be available in the app and in the documentation.)*
